# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/server/.bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/server/db/*.sqlite3
/server/db/*.sqlite3-*

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/server/log/*
/server/tmp/*
!/server/log/.keep
!/server/tmp/.keep

# Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.
/server/tmp/pids/*
!/server/tmp/pids/
!/server/tmp/pids/.keep

# Ignore uploaded files in development.
/server/storage/*
!/server/storage/.keep
/server.byebug_history

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
server/config/master.key
